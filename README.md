# Rust Odds
## An ongoing project to crack the optimal strategy for the Scrap Wheel in the game Rust.

The Scrap Wheel in Rust seems to most an open book...as with any game, the player who tries it is bound to lose. After all, the game *is* rigged. But what if there was a way to understand the Wheel from within?

Current conundrums:
* Does the scrap payout for each color vary? And if so, is there a way to understand its distribution?
* Does the Rust internal code specify a seed for the RNG?
* Does the Wheel have any discernible patterns?

Any feedback / input about your own experiences playing the Scrap Wheel will be greatly appreciated. I would love to collaborate with people who love statistics and Rust, so please contact me!
